Recap on this week's topic:

Wordpress themes are use for changing tha appreance of the website, and you usually have a parent theme and a child theme. The core files that makes up the parent theme are index.php, style.css, and functions.php. Index is the template file that displays the content, styles contains the theme metadata, such as name and author, as well as the css for the website, and functions loads the styles, scripts, and theme features.
The child theme has it's own style and functions, and it inherits everything from the parent but allows customization without modifying the original parent files.
